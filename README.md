!!! IMPORTANT !!

Due to the EPIC Game move theirs assets from Unreal marketplace to FAB, all the data grabing features are not functionning anymore.

I've not time for now to change all the API calls to work with the new marketplace.

Perhaps I'll do that in a future time, perhaps not.

Any help to port these features is welcome !
For that, you can open an issue and make PRs or contact me directly for more info.

**UEVaultManager** is an open-source assets manager that can list assets and
their data from the Epic Games Marketplace. It is developed in Python, so
it can run on any platform that support this language.

Its main purpose is to list the assets (with or without user login),
filter (optional) and save the list into a file that can be reused later
as a data source (in an Excel sheet for instance).
